# Kinetic-Plus
Unfortunately, I did not think to post this on github as I was developing it, so this repo will act as an archive of an old project. 
I wish I could show you my progress from step 1 to infinity but unfortunately, a stressed boy named Roy did not think about that.

This is the software for my senior design project in 2019 - 2020.
